-- About the project --
- Our project aimed to create an online Herbarium, providing a digital repository for preserving and sharing botanical specimens. Traditional herbarium collections are invaluable resources for scientific research, education, and conservation efforts. However, accessing physical specimens can be challenging due to factors such as location, availability, and preservation concerns. By digitizing these collections and making them available online, we aimed to overcome these limitations and promote broader access to botanical knowledge. 

**Key features:**
1. Digitized Workflow: We developed a systematic workflow for digitizing botanical specimens, including specimen imagind, data entry and other nomenclature propositions. This process ensured that specimens were accurately documented and standardized for online access
2. Online Database: We created a centralized database to store digital records of botanical specimens, including images, metadata and associated information such as taxonomy, location etc.
3. User Interface: We designed a user-friendly interface that allows users to register as their own botanical collector, browse, and interact with the digital Herbarium.
